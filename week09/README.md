# COMP2110 Week XX

Briefly summarise the work you've done this week here.

1)Amazon and Netflix are both large and complex websites that are designed to adapt to different screen sizes and device types. When accessed from different devices with varying screen sizes, their layout and design may differ slightly to ensure that the user experience remains consistent and optimized.

Here are some potential differences that could occur when accessing Amazon and Netflix from different browser window sizes on different devices:

Desktop: When accessing either Amazon or Netflix from a desktop computer with a larger screen size, the websites may display more information on the screen at once. For example, Amazon may display more product listings and categories in its navigation bar, while Netflix may show more rows of recommended content. This can allow users to more easily navigate the site and find what they're looking for.

Tablet: On a tablet-sized screen, both Amazon and Netflix may use a responsive design that adapts to the device's orientation. For example, when the device is in landscape mode, the websites may display more information horizontally, while in portrait mode, they may stack content vertically. The layout may also be simplified to ensure that important information and navigation options remain visible without requiring excessive scrolling.

Mobile: When accessed from a mobile device with a smaller screen size, both Amazon and Netflix may use a mobile-first design that prioritizes simplicity and ease of use. The sites may display fewer rows of content at once, and navigation options may be hidden behind menus or icons to save screen real estate. The text and images may also be larger to make them easier to read and interact with on a smaller screen.

Overall, the main differences between the display of Amazon and Netflix on different devices will likely be related to the layout and amount of information displayed on the screen. However, both sites will strive to provide a consistent user experience across all devices by adapting their design to the screen size and device type.

2) Both Amazon and Netflix use a combination of responsive and adaptive design approaches to ensure that their websites are optimized for different screen sizes and devices.

Responsive design refers to a design approach where the website layout and content adapt to the screen size and orientation of the device, without requiring a separate set of code for each device. In other words, the website "responds" to the device it's being viewed on, and adjusts its layout and content accordingly. Responsive design allows for a more flexible and scalable approach to web design, as it can accommodate a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

Adaptive design, on the other hand, involves creating a separate set of code for each device or screen size, and serving that code based on the device being used to access the site. Adaptive design allows for more precise control over how the website appears on different devices, but can be more time-consuming and complex to implement than responsive design.

Both Amazon and Netflix use a responsive design approach for their core website layout and content, which allows them to adapt to a wide range of screen sizes and devices. However, they may also use adaptive design techniques for certain elements of their website, such as navigation menus or specific features that require more precise control over how they appear on different devices. The use of both responsive and adaptive design techniques allows them to create a seamless user experience across a wide range of devices and screen sizes.

3)The number of contents that can be accessed using just a thumb on a mobile device can vary depending on the size of the device and the user's hand size and dexterity. However, in general, it's recommended that key content and functionality be placed within the "thumb zone," which is the area of the screen that can be easily reached with the user's thumb when holding the device with one hand.

According to the "hold and touch" gesture figure in The Fundamental Guide to Mobile Usability, the thumb zone covers the lower half of the screen and the sides of the screen, while the upper half of the screen is more difficult to reach with the thumb.

To practice this, you can hold your mobile device in one hand and try to access different types of content and functionality using only your thumb. For example, you can try to:

Scroll through a webpage or social media feed
Tap on a menu or navigation button
Swipe left or right to view different content
Tap on a specific item or link within the content
While it's possible to access a wide range of content and functionality using just the thumb, other gestures such as swiping with multiple fingers or using two hands may be required for more advanced actions. However, by optimizing the placement of key content and functionality within the thumb zone, designers can ensure that users can easily and comfortably interact with their mobile apps and websites using just one hand.

4)To apply the F-shaped pattern to mobile pages, designers should consider the following tips:

Place important content and functionality in the top bar of the F: This could include a clear and concise headline, a prominent logo or branding element, and key navigation options. Users are more likely to notice and engage with content that is placed in this area of the screen.

Place the most important information and content in the stem of the F: This area is where users tend to focus their attention when scanning the page. Designers should prioritize placing important content, such as calls to action, product descriptions, or other key information, in this area of the screen.

Use shorter paragraphs and sections of content: Users tend to scan content in shorter horizontal movements towards the bottom of the screen. To make this content more scannable, designers should break it up into shorter paragraphs and sections with clear headings and subheadings.

By designing mobile pages with the F-shaped pattern in mind, designers can create a more scannable and user-friendly layout that prioritizes important content and functionality. This can help improve the user experience and increase engagement with the page.

5)Know Your Users: Both Amazon and Netflix likely have a good understanding of their target users and their needs, given their extensive user research and data analysis. They may use tools like analytics and user feedback to gather insights into user behavior and preferences.

Understand Context of Use: Both companies likely consider the context in which users access their services on mobile devices, such as on-the-go, during commutes, or at home. They may design their mobile experiences to be quick and easy to use in these contexts.

Follow the Rule of Thumb(s): Both Amazon and Netflix likely follow the rule of thumb(s) by designing their mobile experiences with the thumb zone in mind, ensuring that key content and functionality is easily accessible with one hand.

Put Content First: Both companies likely prioritize content in their mobile designs, making it easy for users to find and engage with the content they're looking for. They may use techniques like clear headings, visual hierarchy, and progressive disclosure to guide users to the most relevant content.

Stay on (Touch) Target: Both Amazon and Netflix likely aim to make their mobile experiences easy to use and navigate, with clear touch targets for buttons and links. They may also use techniques like haptic feedback to provide users with a sense of confirmation when they interact with touch targets.

Echo Real-world Gestures and Movement: Both companies likely incorporate real-world gestures and movement into their mobile experiences, such as swiping, pinching, and tapping, to make the experience feel more natural and intuitive for users.

Use Progressive Disclosure: Both Amazon and Netflix likely use progressive disclosure to gradually reveal information and functionality to users as they need it. This can help reduce clutter and cognitive load on the mobile screen.

Overall, both Amazon and Netflix appear to follow many of the 7 guiding principles for mobile devices outlined in The Fundamental Guide to Mobile Usability. However, there is always room for improvement. Some changes that could be made to achieve optimal mobile web design include:

Continuously gathering user feedback and data to refine the mobile experience
Conducting regular usability testing to identify areas of friction and opportunities for improvement
Simplifying and streamlining the mobile experience by reducing clutter and unnecessary features
Prioritizing speed and performance to ensure that the mobile experience is fast and responsive
Ensuring that the mobile experience is accessible and inclusive for all users, regardless of ability or device.
